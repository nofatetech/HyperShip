# HyperShip Online

A dev kit that includes software, guids, opinions & conventions, important reasons for those opinions.

The idea is like having a way of creating "serious" and cool experimental apps, plain data or full multimedia 2D or 3D, with a nice Developer Experience, simple tools, opinionated, consistent. It has its PROs and CONs. One set of tools to create anything and publish anywhere. Scalable, simple to implement, one-man-framework like rails, etc.

Accessible to beginners and PROs.



## Seious apps
You can build a full web app with just rails, and then export if necessary to other platforms. Our idea is to use Redot/Godot as the frontend.
Very serious apps you might want to do the traditional way, not with Redot/Godot.
Redot/Godot can handle apps about data, tables, simple graphs, and it could do more creative stuff with that data.



## Visual, fun, experimental, creative apps
Redot/Godot is a game engine, so visuals, interactivity, 2d/3d, audio, are cool things all out of the box.
